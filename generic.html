									<h1><a href="https://dexscreener.com/base">Quant AI: The Future <br />
										of Money</a></h1>
									<p>Quant ($QBAI) is an Artificial Intelligence, tokenized, liquidity-generating trading robot built on the Ethereum Layer 2 Base Chain blockchain. It has a public launch set for November 1st, 2023.
										<p>Quant A.I. starts by using Chat GPT, connected to trading platforms, with algorithmic trading strategies, as well as specialized scanning software, to earn money. When the robot makes profit, it sends a portion of the money back to the liquidity pool, and Quant tokens are burned, increasing the value of Quant for all token holders, meaning the more Quant you own, the more you share in the robotâ€™s profit just for holding Quant.
											In order to earn money, you simply buy, and hold, the Quant token.</p>
		

									<p>Saving up with Quant token is the best store of value for your money today. Designed to be used like a bank, our cutting-edge, A.I. trading robot leverages its acquisition of Quant tokens bought by users, via smart-contracts, to earn large profits for holders like a crypto-secured hedge fund. The new scanning feature we have implemented allows the trading platform to analyze thousands of cryptocurrencies and stocks, and places smart, algorithmic-based trades that result in massive payouts for users. Once profit is made from a successful trade, it is sent back into the liquidity pool and Quant tokens are burned. This increases the value of Quant tokens for all token holders, creating a compounding effect for your money based on this new, algorithmic, deflationary technology, and, in turn, allows the bot to generate even more income for the token. All adopters recieve big rewards for holding Quant tokens; the more you hold, and the longer you hold them, the more yield you earn. The goal is to make the number of circulating Quant tokens in supply reach as close to one as possible, giving birth to the saying "a single Quant can change the world!"</p>

								<p>The API we use has a super-powerful processor with lightning fast reaction time propelling it. In the context of our APIs, our service contract defines how the two AI software applications communicate with each other using request and response queries that offer feedback outputs resulting in huge, sustainable profits for Quant holders. People will ask you where you were at the advent of AI hedge funds. Buy your Quant AI now!</p>
